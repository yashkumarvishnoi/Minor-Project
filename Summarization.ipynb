It was about beating everyone else which, in Olympic history, Britain's never done in the dressage,\" she said.\\n\"So to come here and win any medal would have been amazing but to come here and win gold, I don't think it's sunk in completely yet. But it's an incredible feeling for all three of us and I think we're all really proud of each other and of our horses.\"\\nBritain's dressage team have been an up-and-coming force in the equestrian discipline, which tests understanding between horse and rider as they complete manoeuvres inside an arena.\\nThey finished fifth at Beijing 2008 but confirmed their potential for London 2012 with victory in last year's European Championships.\\nTeam dressage\\nLaura Bechtolsheimer - Carl Hester - Charlotte Dujardin\\nMen's team showjumping\\nNick Skelton - Ben Maher - Scott Brash - Peter Charles\\nThe horse is as important as the rider, if not more so. Hester's Uthopia, Bechtolsheimer's Mistral Hojris - better-known as Alf - and Dujardin's Valegro have now proved, on the biggest stage, that they are three of the best.\\nBritain's team average of 79.979 beat Germany's 78.216 as each of the three British riders defeated their German equivalent in what became a straight fight between the two.\\nFirst to compete in the dressage and going in the individual event only was Richard Davison on Artemis, who let out a disappointed sigh at the end of their outing. The duo scored 70.524 and failed to progress.\\nFor Hester, 45, it was a different story. Buoyed by an excellent start, he and Uthopia produced 80.571, three full marks clear of opening German rival Dorothee Schneider on Diva Royal.\\nBechtolsheimer and Alf followed it with 77.794, again outscoring German counterpart Kristina Sprehe with Desperados, meaning the destination of gold came down to fellow 27-year-old Dujardin.\\nGermany, the defending champions, were the team to beat heading into the Games. Eighteen months ago, German owners spent a fee believed to exceed Â£10m in purchasing star dressage horse Totilas, the 2010 world champion, from the Netherlands.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nBut German rider Matthias Rath, the ex-boyfriend of Britain's Bechtolsheimer, came down with glandular fever prior to the Olympics. Both he and Totilas were withdrawn as a result, damaging Germany's chances of overhauling the host nation.\\nIn the absence of that partnership, Dujardin and Valegro seized their chance to become the stars of their home Olympics, setting an Olympic record last week before her second ride confirmed a memorable and historic first-ever team dressage title.\\nHer score of 83.286 put Britain well out of reach and into the record books for the most successful Olympic campaign in 104 years.</td>\n",

The American fans like to see a tear-up.\\n\"I've seen two quality, classy boxers here and the whole crowd has booed them, so I might have to do some fighting.\"\\nIf Selby needs to scrap with Barros, he will do so. He will have to be versatile if his dream fight with Frampton is to materialise.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nIf Selby needs to fight Barros tactically and pragmatically, he will do so too. The Welshman will take whatever action he deems necessary to win.\\nHe would like to do so with a flourish, to defend his title for a third time in a manner convincing enough to enhance his burgeoning reputation in America.\\nWhat he cannot consider is defeat.\\n\"I treat every fight the same.

We were solid and looked dangerous on the break.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\n\"Joe Allen was immense for us today. He has got great energy and awareness and sees things earlier than most people.\\n\"When you come to places like Old Trafford your keeper has to have a good day and that happened. He saved many number of shots. He's a good keeper, a good character, and we're pleased he's with us.\\n\"We're more like the Stoke that we know we can be. We've got players back, continuity at the back so that's helping us. We've found a form and a mix of players which will help us short term, if not long term.\"\\nManchester United travel to rivals Liverpool after the international break.
